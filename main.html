            Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. 
            Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being 
            found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; 
            along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red.
